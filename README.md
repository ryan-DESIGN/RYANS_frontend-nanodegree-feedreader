# Project Overview

This web-based application reads RSS feeds.

Jasmine tests were written against the pre-existing application to ensure the underlying business logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation works without needing a manual tester.

# How to run this application and see it's Jasmine functionality:

1. Install npm's simple http server if you haven't already.
2. Run `http-server -p 8080` from within the project's top-level directory.
3. Load your network address, with port 8080 (or one of your choosing), e.g., 192.168.0.1:8080
4. The application will run the Jasmine tests automatically and print the results at the bottom of the web-page.
